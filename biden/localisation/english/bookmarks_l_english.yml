 GATHERING_STORM_NAME:0 "A Turning Tide"
 GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The world has changed. Globally speaking, an atmosphere of peace and prosperity has ruled for about half a century. But with the recent end of the Cold War, the recent rise of the People's Republic of China, how will this world see itself? How will it shape itself? Will the United States continue its dominance? Will the new Russian Federation find the way into the spotlight? What roles will the former great European empires of Britain, France and Germany play? And what role will the shadow of terrorism have? The world has changed. The world is changing."
 DEN_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Denmark is in a safe and sound spot, being both a member of the EU and NATO. Internal economic downturn and slowdown have however been recently challenging the Danish state."
 ENG_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "With Hong Kong handed over to China in 1997, the United Kingdom has seen its last great colonial possession go. The once mightiest nation on earth is trying desperately to find a new path to greatness and glory. But will that path lie in continued cooperation with the United States? Should Britain draw closer to its European brethren? Or shall Britannia, on her own, rule the waves once more?"
 ETH_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Ethiopia's monarchy was overthrown in 1974 and its subsequent communist dictatorship in 1991. The constitution of 1995 has provided a somewhat stable democracy, but it has failed to address the problems of starvation, political crisis and corruption. It has also not resolved Ethiopia's ongoing conflict with Eritrea."
 FIN_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Ever concerned with preserving its neutrality, Finland has carefully watched the Soviet Union's collapse and the subsequent political expansion of the western European forces. The Finns joined the EU in 1995 and is about to adopt the Euro as the national currency. Can peace last? Are the Russians truly pacified?"
 FRA_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "France, the Grande Nation of old, has tried to find a new spot in an ever-changing world. With old rivals and old friends firmly by her side, with new opponents and new threats on the horizon, France will have to decide if the future of the cradle of democracy shall be unity and peace or a return to more darker times."
 GER_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Germany is now reunited for almost a decade. Economically stronger than ever, though with the outlook of a recession in the future, Germany needs to find new goals in this world. The freshly independent states of Eastern Europe are in the process of joining the European Union, where Germany holds significant influence. Germany, though troubled by its dark past, looks at a bright future."
 ICE_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "In a hidden corner of Europe, Iceland has successfully kept a low profile since independence in 1944. Political conflicts with the British about fishing rights were perhaps the most exciting time in Icelandic history. Should Iceland take a more central stance?"
 ITA_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Italy has been ever so slightly behind the other Great Powers since the beginning of the 20th Century. After the defeat in World War Two, Italy's strong bond to its former enemies and its former ally in Germany has brought them back up to the state of a highly developed and prosperous country. But what will the future hold? National greatness or economic disaster?"
 JAP_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Japan, the second-biggest economy on earth, has been the powerhouse of East Asian democracies ever since the Second World War ended. Backed by American and European allies and protected by a powerful industrial base, Japan looks at its old rival China with new confidence and new potential for conflict."
 NOR_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Norway voted against joining the European Union in 1995 and has subsequently stayed distant from Europe to some point. Norway however still remains a NATO member and shares a short but critical border with the Russian Federation."
 PRC_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "China, the backwater of yesterday, is the super power of tomorrow. Its industrial base great, its political influence growing, its military modernizing and its workforce nearly infinite, China has to fear only one thing: If it reforms too slowly, it might be destroyed. If it reforms too quickly, it might destroy itself."
 RAJ_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Where China is the super power of tomorrow, India is the super power of next week. Its constant struggles against Pakistan and China as well as its deep economic connection to the west have given India a niche to prosper. If it is given enough time, the Tiger of South Asia will be strong enough to take out every single one of its enemies."
 SOV_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "When the Soviet Union collapsed in 1991, it was clear that the path back to glory would not be easy for the Russian Federation. The system and economy corrupt, the military big but outdated and the political outreach weakened, Russia had to accept to be on the sidelines for a decade. Now, it is looking to get back into the spotlight."
 SPR_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Since Franco's death in 1975, Spain has been on a long path of recovery. Through economic and social hardship, the country managed to partially work through the issues that decades of falangism had caused. Spain joined NATO (1982) and the EU (1986) and has tirelessly and under the greatest of efforts worked to catch up to the more powerful and wealthy major countries of Europe; to Germany, France, Britain and Italy.\nIn times like these, Spain requires strong leadership and a stable hand. Can Prime Minister Aznar deliver? Or will his Partido Popular make place for a more worthy leadership?"
 SWE_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Sweden had been in a deep economic crisis in the early 1990s, with the country's EU accession in 1995 doing only little to amend the issues. Sweden, which stays militarily neutral as is Swedish tradition, has to find economic answers."
 SWI_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Neutral since times immemorial, Switzerland has decided to stay out of not only NATO and the European Union, but also even the United Nations. Can the international community still rely on Switzerland to be the silent judge and the neutral ground it has always been? Or will the Swiss people see their government take a more active role abroad in order to preserve peace and enforce Swiss national interests?"
 USA_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The citizens of the United States have known little but victory in the last century. Winning the World Wars, winning the Cold War; the United States had a nearly perfect track record up until now. But with China emerging on the side of the ocean, with Russia pushing for renewed greatness, with terrorism an ever so great threat, what can America do to stay dominant?"
 OTHER_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "World War One, World War Two, Korea, Vietnam, Afghanistan. The wars of the past have left the nations of the present fearing for the future. However, there is great hope that humanity might have passed 20 centuries of bloodshed to complete its transition to a period of peace and stability."
